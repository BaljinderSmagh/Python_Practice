# Writing a Code In a Clean and Modular way
  * Use meaningful names for variables and functions.
  * Long Names doesn't imply descriptive names
  * Avoid using abbrevations and single letters names.
  * For Boolean variables, it helpful to use a prefix with the name like 'is_effective' or 'has_effective'.
  * Organize your code line with consistent indentation(standard is to use four space for each indent).
  * Try to separate the different sections of your code with blank lines.
  * Try to keep your lines to roughly 79 characters, which is the PEP 8 style guide's recommendation.
  * Including Docstring to explain the functionality of any function in yor code.

# How to make your code efficient?
  * Reducing run time.
  * Reducing space it occupies in memory.
  
# Testing the Code
  * Testing your code is important before deploying it to production.
  * Unexpected data can break your given assumptions.
  * You can write test cases to check your code.
  * We can use unit Testing to avoid writing repeatable code for testing and it is isolated from the your main code.
  * Pytest is a python library you can for unit testing. it will run all the tests even one of the test set fails.
