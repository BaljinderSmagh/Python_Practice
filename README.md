# Writing a Code In a Clean and Modular way
  * Use meaningful names for variables and functions.
  * Long Names doesn't imply descriptive names
  * Avoid using abbrevations and single letters names.
  * For Boolean variables, it helpful to use a prefix with the name like 'is_effective' or 'has_effective'.
  * Organize your code line with consistent indentation(standard is to use four space for each indent).
  * Try to separate the different sections of your code with blank lines.
  * Try to keep your lines to roughly 79 characters, which is the PEP 8 style guide's recommendation.
